Scott, a 30-year vim veteran, will explain why he thinks that, in 2025, vim is
an editor worthy of your consideration. He will describe the perils that have
befallen prior generations of proprietary editors.  He will tell you how vim
can make you more productive.  He will help you get a very basic vim setup on
your development machine so that you can begin to learn vim motions and enjoy
frictionless editing experience that vim provides.

This entire presentation was made in vim.
