# vim and neovim

- vim development was guided by Bram Moolenaar
- neovim forked in 2014 with an initial focus on code modernization and
  expanded scope of contribution
  - Added Lua scripting
  - Added built-in LSP client
- If you are getting started today, it is probably best to start with neovim,
  as the availability of Lua scripting has led to an explosion of plugin
  development
  - For this talk, we will install and use vim, as it is easier and faster to
    get to the tutorial on a variety of platforms

# vim is hard to install

---

# vim can be hard to learn

- Users are expected to go out and find features rather than having features
  surfaced for them
  - This, though, is what allows vim to be very clean, focused, and fast in the
    hands of an experienced user
  - Case in point, vim has an excellent help system and tutorial, but you need
    to know they are there and how to invoke them.
